  # Strategies listed must be available from the chart which is loaded through the "url" parameter. Although, you can
  # define multiple strategies here there is no way to "select" a particular strategy from a list of strategies. My
  # hope is that one day we'll be able to do so in TV. Until such time, don't define more than one strategy on a layout.
  # Multi layout strategies can be used to test multiple time frames simultaneously. If you need more strategies
  # than you are allowed to have on your layout you can define additional 'charts' in this yaml.
  # For multiple chart layouts to work 'Sync On All Charts' should be set for 'Symbol' and each chart on the layout
  # should have the same strategy (with the same inputs and properties) but on a different time frame.
  strategies:
    # Kairos will look for the first indicator on a pane within a chart that starts with the value defined below
  - name: "Trade Pro - EMA Cross strategy"
#  - name: "RSI strategy"
    # Define on which pane the strategy is.
    # Use 0 for the 1st pane on your chart, 1 for the 2nd pane, etc. The top pane has always index 0.
    pane_index: 0
    # Define the inputs with their allowed values. You should only define inputs and properties that differ from the
    # default settings.
    # Use the names of the inputs/properties to set the value of that input/property.
    # Use lowercase only, use underscore (_) instead of white space, and ignore non-latin non-number characters.
    # For example: input 'Max. Width Of Price W/M' becomes 'max_width_of_price_wm'.
    # You can define a list of values by defining a comma separated list in brackets, e.g. [0, 2, 4, 8], or [yes, no]
    # You can define a range of values by using white space, underscore, white space ( - ).
    # You can define an increment for a range by using the special operator ampersand (&) directly after the range, and
    # followed by the increment.
    # Ranges can be integers as well as decimal numbers.
    # Example ranges:
    #   create strategies for the values between 5 and 13 (including 13): 5 - 13
    #   create strategies for the values between 0 and 8 with an increment of 2: 0 - 8&2
    #   create strategies for the values between 0 and 0.25 with an increment of 0.05: 0.0 - 0.25&0.05
    #
    # NOTE: Kairos will run all the symbols of the watchlist(s) for every separate option. Having a strategy for
    # 500 symbols and say 5 options can easily take a few hours.
